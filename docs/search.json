I also spend a lot time hiking, snowboarding and biking around town."

    "text": "Installing high elevation site one month post fire!\n\n\nPreviously, I worked as a field technician for Dr Stephanie Kampf researching post-fire hydrologic responses. This work focused on the streamflow responses from changes in snow pack characteristics. Dr Kampf and others published this paper on that work: Increasing wildfire impacts on snowpack in the western U.S.\n\n\n\nDeepest snowpit for the season!\n\n\nThrough this work, I got experience installing various sensors and learning methods to measure snowpack and streamflow. I also learned how to qualitatively assess watershed characteristics through site selection and watershed surveys.\n\n\n\nField visit to 6 small catchments to determine suitability for future studies."

This project will also eventually include water quality sondes which will be used to help warn downstream users when water quality is impaired from either algal blooms or sedimentation."
