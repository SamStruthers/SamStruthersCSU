Hi!

My name is Sam Struthers and I am currently a researcher in the ROSS Lab at Colorado State University (Fort Collins).

I am very passionate about water resources in the Western US.

I hope to build my data science and analysis skills to help people all over the world be able to track water quality in their local watershed.

Outside of water, I love to rock climb with my specialty being bouldering. I also spend a lot time hiking, snowboarding and biking around town.

random_facts = c(
  "I lived in Costa Rica for a year when I was in second grade", 
  "I swam in every high alpine lake we camped at during a 3 week backpacking trip" )

```
