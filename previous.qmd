## Kampf Lab:

![Installing high elevation site one month post fire!](previous1.HEIC){fig-align="left" width="454"}

Previously, I worked as a field technician for Dr Stephanie Kampf researching post-fire hydrologic responses. This work focused on the streamflow responses from changes in snow pack characteristics. Dr Kampf and others published this paper on that work: [Increasing wildfire impacts on snowpack in the western U.S.](https://doi.org/10.1073/pnas.2200333119)

Through this work, I got experience installing various sensors and learning methods to measure snowpack and streamflow. I also learned how to qualitatively assess watershed characteristics through site selection and watershed surveys.
